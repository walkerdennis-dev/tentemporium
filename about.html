        <p>I am a student currently learning about dynamic web design. I have created this site because I have a strong background in camping.
         I realize the importance of a tent when camping and how it can make or break your experience. In my experiences I have seen tents that leaked when no other tent would as well as tents that stayed dry when no others would.
        </p>

        <p>All of this camping experience has come from my long career in scouting. I have gone on many camping trips in all different kinds of weather.
         These camping experiences I have gathered over the years have helped me to see the importance of the shelter you choose. I hope to pass my experiences and advice on to those who seek to enjoy camping like I do.</p>

        <p>With this website I hope to show you a selection of high-quality and affordable tents. I have gathered a selection of tents from a few different categories and have brought them all to this site.
         This selection of tents is ideal for the family just getting into camping or the camping pro who is looking to upgrade his gear.</p>

        <p>By bringing you this selection of tents you can experience the joys of camping as I have. These tents are for many different purposes. Some tents can fit a wood stove in them to stay warm.
         Other tents are very light and can be packed tightly for backpacking. I hope you can find the tent you need on this site.</p>
